## Title: Rocket Watch

## Description: 
A web-based app that allows the user to view and keep track of local rocket launches. Three pages make up the project and are appropriately named Login, Settings, and Dashboard.


## STORY**: 
John mentioned there was a big rocket launch on Sunday. Madison corrected to note that the launch had been moved to Tuesday. Now the launch is on Wednesday. If only there was a notification system that updated users of rocket launch schedule changes... 

We would love to develop a mobile app with push notifications for changes in APIs or twitter mentions citing specific rocket launch details. Mobile development and live API refresh were waring efforts, so we simplified things. 

You come across a dark, space-themed, login page in which a simple click keeps you from entering the meat of the website. If this is your first time visiting the page you must set up your account on the settings page. The settings page gives you a map of the world with popular launch pads. You may click your nearest launch pad or select multiple to view. Also available on the settings would be a favorite rocket selector.

On the final/main/dashboard page you will find a display of the next launch. The main page will display:
- Rocket
- Image
- Countdown timer
- Location
- Date and time
- Payload details
- Twitter snippet with filtered updates
- A button to load more launches
