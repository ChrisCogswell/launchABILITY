## Solid Project Foundation

### Title: Rocket Watch

### Description: 
A web-based app that allows the user to view and keep track of local rocket launches. Three pages make up the project and are appropriately named Login, Settings, and Dashboard.

### STORY**: 
John mentioned there was a big rocket launch on Sunday. Madison corrected to note that the launch had been moved to Tuesday. Now the launch is on Wednesday. If only there was a notification system that updated users of rocket launch schedule changes... 

We would love to develop a mobile app with push notifications for changes in APIs or twitter mentions citing specific rocket launch details. Mobile development and live API refresh were waring efforts, so we simplified things. 

You come across a dark, space-themed, login page in which a simple click keeps you from entering the meat of the website. If this is your first time visiting the page you must set up your account on the settings page. The settings page gives you a map of the world with popular launch pads. You may click your nearest launch pad or select multiple to view. Also available on the settings would be a favorite rocket selector.

On the final/main/dashboard page you will find a display of the next launch. The main page will display:
- Rocket
- Image
- Countdown timer
- Location
- Date and time
- Payload details
- Twitter snippet with filtered updates
- A button to load more launches

### APIs Identified
- [x] Launch Library
- [ ] Twitter
- [ ] Weather
- [ ] Google Maps


## MVP
1. Start with a general idea.
   1. Rocket launch information application where the user can select launch locations, view upcoming rockets launched at each location, and be presented with details about each launch.
1. Identify the target audience.
   1. The target audience includes individuals interested in space exploration, satellite tech, SpaceX, NASA, Elon Musk, Falcon rockets, and the general population local to each launch center in Florida, California, and Virginia.
1. Identify the problem that the product will address.
   1. John mentioned there was a big rocket launch on Sunday. Madison corrected to note that the launch had been moved to Tuesday. Chris mentioned the launch is now on Wednesday. If only there was a notification system that updated users of rocket launch schedule changes... Notifications turned to be a future endeavor, and for now, the group has refocused to the primary goal of the product:
1. Write down the primary goal of the product.
   1. As a user, I want information on local rocket launches, so that I know when to (go outside) (look up) (look out the window) (pull over) (drive towards the launch site). 
1. Identify and prioritize essential user stories.
    1. As a user, I want to select which location to monitor, so that I can view rocket launches in my area. 
    1. As a user, I want to view the upcoming rocket launch, so that I know what I am looking at. 
    1. As a user, I want to view related information, so that I can learn about rockets. 
    1. As a user, I want links to live broadcasts so that I can watch the launch on my phone. 
    1. As a user, I want a Twitter feed, so that I can read Elon Musk talk about his rockets. 
    1. As a user, I want animations, so that I will stay entertained an interested. 
    1. As a user, I want the application to be beautiful so that I decide to return to this app over others.
